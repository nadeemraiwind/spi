# Technical Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is a modular web application built using PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and MySQL. It is designed to provide a robust and dynamic user experience while maintaining a clean and organized code structure. The backend is designed to expose RESTful APIs for future Android app integration.

## Core Systems

### 1. Kernel System
The kernel system is the core of the application, responsible for bootstrapping and managing the app's lifecycle. It initializes all core components, such as routing, database handling, and module loading.

#### Responsibilities:
- Load configurations.
- Initialize core components (e.g., database, routing, modules).
- Handle requests and responses.

#### Implementation:
- File: `src/core/Kernel.php`
- Example:
```php
class Kernel {
    public function boot() {
        $this->loadConfig();
        $this->initializeDatabase();
        $this->initializeRouting();
        $this->initializeModules();
    }
}
```

---

### 2. Modular System
The modular system allows dynamic addition and removal of features. Each module is self-contained with its own assets, templates, and logic.

#### Responsibilities:
- Dynamically load and register modules.
- Provide a structure for module development.

#### Implementation:
- File: `src/core/ModuleLoader.php`
- Example:
```php
class ModuleLoader {
    public static function loadModules() {
        $modulesDir = __DIR__ . '/../modules/';
        foreach (scandir($modulesDir) as $module) {
            if ($module !== '.' && $module !== '..') {
                require_once $modulesDir . $module . '/module.php';
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Routing System
The routing system maps URLs to specific controllers or actions. It supports dynamic routes and HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).

#### Responsibilities:
- Handle incoming requests.
- Map routes to appropriate callbacks or controllers.

#### Implementation:
- File: `src/core/Router.php`
- Example:
```php
class Router {
    public static function addRoute($method, $path, $callback) {
        self::$routes[] = ['method' => $method, 'path' => $path, 'callback' => $callback];
    }
}
```

---

### 4. Database Handling System
The database handling system provides a centralized way to interact with the database using PDO for secure and efficient queries.

#### Responsibilities:
- Establish a database connection.
- Execute queries securely using prepared statements.

#### Implementation:
- File: `src/core/Database.php`
- Example:
```php
class Database {
    public static function connect() {
        self::$connection = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=my_database", "root", "password");
    }
}
```

## RESTful API Design
The backend exposes RESTful APIs for core functionalities like user authentication, module management, and CRUD operations.

### API Structure:
- Base URL: `/api/v1/`
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /users`: Fetch all users.
  - `POST /auth`: Authenticate a user.
  - `GET /modules`: Fetch all modules.

### Authentication:
- Use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for secure communication.

---

## Frontend Design
The frontend is divided into two main interfaces:
1. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Manage modules and settings.
   - Accessed via `src/core/admin.php`.

2. **User Dashboard**:
   - Personalized user interface.
   - Accessed via `src/user/index.php`.

### Responsive Design:
- Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsive layouts.

---

## Environment Configuration
Sensitive information like database credentials is stored in a `.env` file. Use the `vlucas/phpdotenv` library to load these variables.

### Example `.env` File:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=my_database
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=secret
```

---

## Testing
The project includes unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.

### Testing Framework:
- Use PHPUnit for testing.

### Testing Checklist:
- Unit tests for core functionalities (e.g., routing, database handling).
- Integration tests for RESTful APIs.
- UI tests for admin and user dashboards.

---

## Future Enhancements
1. **Module Installation System**:
   - Validate and register modules dynamically.
   - Include a detailed implementation plan for module validation and registration.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Manage user permissions (e.g., admin, user).
   - Add a design or strategy for implementing RBAC.

3. **Centralized Logging**:
   - Use a library like Monolog for error logging.
   - Provide a brief example or plan for integrating Monolog.

4. **API Documentation**:
   - Use Swagger or Postman to document API endpoints.
   - Add a section on how to set up and maintain API documentation.

5. **Android App Integration**:
   - Plan for features like push notifications and offline support.
   - Expand on how the backend will support these features.

## Conclusion
This technical document provides a comprehensive overview of the project's architecture and implementation. By following the outlined systems and best practices, the project is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and ready for future enhancements like Android app integration.

## API Documentation Updates
### New Guidelines
- All new API endpoints must be documented in this file.
- Include the following details for each endpoint:
  - HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
  - Endpoint URL.
  - Request parameters and their types.
  - Response format and examples.

### Example:
#### Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/auth`
- **Description**: Authenticate a user and return a JWT token.
- **Request Parameters**:
  - `username` (string): The user's username.
  - `password` (string): The user's password.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
  }
```
